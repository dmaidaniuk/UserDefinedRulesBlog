<span class="SubHeader">java.util.TreeMap.put() and java.util.TreeSet.add() changed their implementation</span>
<p>
The <code>java.util.TreeMap.put()</code> method has been changed and is bad now because I said so and we should NEVER use it.
Replace the <code>java.util.TreeMap.put()</code> method with <code>java.util.TreeMap.putAll()</code> because I think it's better.
You don't have to because this is only a suggestion.

Also, the <code>java.util.TreeMap.add()</code> method has been changed and is bad now because I said so and we should NEVER use it.
Replace the <code>java.util.TreeMap.add()</code> method with <code>java.util.TreeMap.addAll()</code> because I think it's better.
